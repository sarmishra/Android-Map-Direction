# Android-Map-Direction
This Android project provides map-based navigation, allowing users to get directions from their current location to a selected destination by tapping on the map. I integrated the Google Directions API to display real-time driving routes, enabling smooth and accurate navigation between points. The app enhances user experience by offering a simple and intuitive way to explore routes and reach destinations efficiently.
